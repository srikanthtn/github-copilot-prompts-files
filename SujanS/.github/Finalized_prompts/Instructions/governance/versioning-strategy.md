# Versioning Strategy

## Purpose
Ensure traceability and reproducibility of instruction and prompt evolution.

## Versioning Rules
- All instruction files must be versioned.
- Version changes must be documented.
- Backward compatibility impact must be assessed.

## Version Semantics
- Major: Regulatory or behavioral change
- Minor: Clarification or controlled extension
- Patch: Non-behavioral correction

## Prohibited
- Unversioned changes
- Overwriting historical versions
- Ambiguous version identifiers
