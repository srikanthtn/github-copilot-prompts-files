# Data Privacy – Global

## Purpose
Define rules for handling personal, financial, and regulatory-sensitive data.

## Privacy Principles
- Data minimization is mandatory.
- Data usage must be purpose-bound.
- Retention must follow declared lifecycle rules.

## Handling Rules
- Sensitive data must be masked where exposure is not required.
- Data sharing across domains must be explicitly authorized.
- Cross-border data movement must follow regulatory constraints.

## Prohibited
- Logging raw personal or financial identifiers
- Storing sensitive data without justification
- Using data beyond its declared purpose

## Interpretation Rule
When ambiguity exists, restrict access.
