# Risk & Compliance – Prohibited Patterns

## Explicitly Prohibited
- Bypassing risk evaluation
- Hardcoded thresholds without governance
- Embedded compliance logic inside execution flows
- Silent overrides of controls

## Architectural Violations
- Mixing execution and control responsibilities
- Cross-domain control circumvention
- Undocumented exception paths
