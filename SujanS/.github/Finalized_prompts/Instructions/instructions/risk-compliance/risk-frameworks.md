# Risk & Compliance – Risk Frameworks

## Framework Principles
- Risk evaluation must be systematic and reproducible.
- Risk models must be transparent and explainable.
- Frameworks must be consistently applied across domains.

## Core Rules
- Risk inputs must be explicitly defined.
- Risk outputs must be traceable to inputs.
- Model assumptions must be documented.

## Prohibited
- Opaque risk scoring
- Undocumented model changes
- Domain-specific risk shortcuts
