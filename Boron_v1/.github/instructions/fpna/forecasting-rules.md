# FP&A – Forecasting Rules

## Forecasting Principles
- Forecasts must be reproducible from inputs and assumptions.
- Forecast logic must be deterministic for a given input set.
- Multiple forecast versions must be explicitly distinguishable.

## Core Rules
- All assumptions must be explicitly declared.
- Forecast time horizons must be clearly defined.
- Scenario differences must be traceable to assumption changes.

## Invariants
- Historical actuals must not be overwritten by forecasts.
- Forecast calculations must be explainable.
- Forecast outputs must be internally consistent.

## Prohibited
- Implicit assumptions
- Silent forecast recalculation
- Mixing actual and forecast data without separation
