# Accounting & Audit – Accounting Standards

## Standards Alignment
All accounting records must align with applicable accounting standards
(e.g., IFRS, GAAP, or jurisdiction-specific standards as configured).

## Core Rules
- Every accounting entry must be backed by a source financial event.
- Entries must be balanced and internally consistent.
- Accounting periods must be respected and enforced.

## Invariants
- Debit and credit totals must balance.
- Entries must be reproducible from source data.
- Classification rules must be deterministic.

## Prohibited
- Manual override of accounting classifications
- Silent adjustments without traceable justification
- Mixing accounting logic with operational logic
